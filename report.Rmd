## Introduction

Buying a house is one of the largest financial decisions many people will make. So many factors go into someone's decision, but it can be hard to really explain why one house "felt right" and another didn't. We want to quantify the factors that add up to someone making the decision to purchase a house.

## Data Description

We will be using the Ames, Iowa individual residential property sales data set freely available on Kaggle.com.  The dataset contains 2,930 observations with 79 explanatory variables. All observations occur between 2006 and 2010. Given the geography dependent nature of home value, the results of below analyses can't be applied nationally.

## Exploratory Analysis

First, let's read our data into our R session and take a look at the explanatory variables in the training dataset.

```{r read}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
library(skimr)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
})
ames <- read.csv('data/train1.csv')
skim_to_wide(ames) %>%
  select(type, variable, missing, n, top_counts, mean, sd, median, hist) %>%
  kable()
```
